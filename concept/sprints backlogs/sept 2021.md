I decided i will stick to working on backend for the time being - it seems like a better use of my time.
Having a finished and viable version of server-side software I will start thinking about UI.

# Plans for this month:
1. Work on routine activities - maybe move them to a separate service? 
2. Create entpoints for retrieving more data about routines - such as percentage of fails, which activity are hardest etc.
3. As in point 2 but for activities of a given routine
4. Points 2 and 3 should be as a separate module
5. Add missing unit tests for all services <- done
