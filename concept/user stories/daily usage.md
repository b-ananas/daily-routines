## Tom is a user of Daily Routines app. He is interested in self-improvement, but he strugles with discipline.
He has 3 daily routines: `morning`, `workout`, `evening`:

Every `morning` he wakes up to an alarm clock. He is presented with weather forecast and his commuting option (ex. train timetable). After fullfulling every point in his routine (ex. eating breakfast, morning higiene, meditaion etc.) he marks it as done (green color). 
If he didn't fully complete a point (ex. he ate breakfast, but didn't make it as nutrishous as he wished) he may mark it as partially done (yellow color)
If he failed at one of his point he marks it as unsuccesful (red color) or he can fill it later this day.

After that, he goes to work. There he gets a reminder about his `workout`. He has forgotten about it, but due to a supply delay he has an hour off â€” he uses it to go for a walk and marks his workout routine as partially done

Having came back home he takes a nap and goes to fullfilling his `evening` routine. The most important part of it is planning his next day. He remembers that he planned on going out with his boyfriend this week, so he calls him and they decide to meet tomorrow.
He pins his weekly routine of going out to tomorrows day. It will behave similiar to daily routine on this day, but if he fails he can simply unpin it and do it later this week

Having finished his evening routine he remembers about his workouts. Tom does a few sets of pushups and pullups, after which he desides he is done with training for this day. He changes the status of `workout` to finished.
