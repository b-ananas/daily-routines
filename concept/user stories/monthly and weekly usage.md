## Edward is a user of Daily Routines app. 
He does not care about his daily habits â€” he focuses mostly on things he does irregularily. 
Because he has reminders enabled, he receives reminders about his weekly and monthly habits. Edward uses it to stay connected with his high school friends. 
He has monthly routines set for each of his friends. Throughout the month he receives reminders from each of them randomly, until he marks it as done for this week.
Edward tends to neglect his houseplants which require fertilizing every week. To make it easier on him, he uses our platform. He recieves reminders about his task every few days, until he marks this routine as finished

He can pin any of his weekly routines to specific day in this week. The same applies for monthly routines, which can be pinned both to a specific week or a specific day.
